In order to study, understand and classify a particular aspect of process engineering in its diversity we associate a set of facets with each aspect.

abstract = {System development and engineering is a comprehensive discipline involving a mul- titude of activities such as requirements engineering, design and specification, im- plementation, testing, and deployment. An increasing number of system develop- ment projects are concerned with concurrent systems. There are numerous exam- ples of this, ranging from large-scale systems, in the areas of telecommunication and applications based on Internet technology, to medium- or small- scale systems, in the area of embedded systems. Section 1.1 introduces the basic ideas and motivation for modelling in system development, and Sect. 1.2 gives a high-level overview of the CPN modelling lan- guage. Section 1.3 discusses the role of abstraction and visualisation when one is constructing models of concurrent systems. Section 1.4 presents the benefits of for- mal modelling languages and verification. Section 1.5 gives an overview of the main features of CPN Tools. Finally, Sect. 1.6 provides an overview of the results from four industrial projects using CP-nets. A more detailed description of the projects will be given in Chap. 14.},

abstract = {The plethora of process modeling notations available today illustrates the relevance of process modeling. Some organizations may use only informal process models to structure discussions and to document procedures. However, organizations that operate at a higher BPM maturity level use models that can be analyzed and used to enact operational processes. Today, most process models are made by hand and are not based on a rigorous analysis of existing process data. This chapter serves two purposes. On the one hand, preliminaries are presented that will be used in later chapters. For example, various process modeling notations are introduced and some analysis techniques are reviewed. On the other hand, the chapter reveals the limitations of classical approaches, thus motivating the need for process mining.},

At the same time, it discusses how BPM needs to be further developed to successfully act as a driver for innovation in a digital world. In recent decades, BPM has proven extremely successful in managing both continuous and radical improvements in many sectors and business areas. While the digital age brings tremendous new opportunities, it also brings the specific challenge of correctly positioning and scoping BPM in organizations. This book shows how to leverage BPM to drive business innovation in the digital age. It brings together the views of the world's leading experts on BPM and also presents a number of practical cases. It addresses mangers as well as academics who share an interest in digital innovation and business process management. The book covers topics such as BPM and big data, BPM and the Internet of Things, and BPM and social media. While these technological and methodological aspects are key to BPM, process experts are also aware that further nontechnical organizational capabilities are required for successful innovation. The ideas presented in this book have helped us a lot while implementing process innovations in our global Logistics Service Center.Joachim Gantner, Director IT Services, Swarovski AGManaging Processes – everyone talks about it, very few really know how to make it work in today's agile and competitive world.

abstract = {Contemporary workflow management systems are driven by explicit process models, i.e., a completely specified workflow design is required in order to enact a given workflow process. Creating a workflow design is a complicated time-consuming process and, typically, there are discrepancies between the actual workflow processes and the processes as perceived by the management. Therefore, we have developed techniques for discovering workflow models. The starting point for such techniques is a so-called "workflow log" containing information about the workflow process as it is actually being executed. We present a new algorithm to extract a process model from such a log and represent it in terms of a Petri net. However, we also demonstrate that it is not possible to discover arbitrary workflow processes. We explore a class of workflow processes that can be discovered. We show that the $\alpha$-algorithm can successfully mine any workflow represented by a so-called SWF-net.},

abstract = {Increasingly organizations are using process mining to under-stand the way that operational processes are executed. Process mining can be used to systematically drive innovation in a digitalized world. Next to the automated discovery of the real underlying process, there are process-mining techniques to analyze bottlenecks, to uncover hidden inefficiencies, to check compliance, to explain deviations, to predict per-formance, and to guide users towards " better " processes. Dozens (if not hundreds) of process-mining techniques are available and their value has been proven in many case studies. However, process mining stands or falls with the availability of event logs. Existing techniques assume that events are clearly defined and refer to precisely one case (i.e. process instance) and one activity (i.e., step in the process). Although there are systems that directly generate such event logs (e.g., BPM/WFM sys-tems), most information systems do not record events explicitly. Cases and activities only exist implicitly. However, when creating or using pro-cess models " raw data " need to be linked to cases and activities. This paper uses a novel perspective to conceptualize a database view on event data. Starting from a class model and corresponding object models it is shown that events correspond to the creation, deletion, or modification of objects and relations. The key idea is that events leave footprints by changing the underlying database. Based on this an approach is described that scopes, binds, and classifies data to create " flat " event logs that can be analyzed using traditional process-mining techniques.},

The results can be used for examining the suitability of a particular process language or workflow system for a particular project, assessing relative strengths and weaknesses of various approaches to process specification, implementing certain business requirements in a particular process-aware information system, and as a basis for language and tool development.

abstract = {Cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) are two very different technologies that are both already part of our life. Their adoption and use are expected to be more and more pervasive, making them important components of the Future Internet. A novel paradigm where Cloud and IoT are merged together is foreseen as disruptive and as an enabler of a large number of application scenarios. In this paper, we focus our attention on the integration of Cloud and IoT, which is what we call the CloudIoT paradigm. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud and IoT separately and, more precisely, their main properties, features, underlying technologies, and open issues. However, to the best of our knowledge, these works lack a detailed analysis of the new CloudIoT paradigm, which involves completely new applications, challenges, and research issues. To bridge this gap, in this paper we provide a literature survey on the integration of Cloud and IoT. Starting by analyzing the basics of both IoT and Cloud Computing, we discuss their complementarity, detailing what is currently driving to their integration. Thanks to the adoption of the CloudIoT paradigm a number of applications are gaining momentum: we provide an up-to-date picture of CloudIoT applications in literature, with a focus on their specific research challenges. These challenges are then analyzed in details to show where the main body of research is currently heading. We also discuss what is already available in terms of platforms–both proprietary and open source–and projects implementing the CloudIoT paradigm. Finally, we identify open issues and future directions in this field, which we expect to play a leading role in the landscape of the Future Internet.},

abstract = {The development and validation of fault-tolerant computers for critical real-time applications are currently both costly and time consuming. Often, the underlying technology is out-of-date by the time the computers are ready for deployment. Obsolescence can become a chronic problem when the systems in which they are embedded have lifetimes of several decades. This paper gives an overview of the work carried out in a project that is tackling the issues of cost and rapid obsolescence by defining a generic fault-tolerant computer architecture based essentially on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components (both processor hardware boards and real-time operating systems). The architecture uses a limited number of specific, but generic, hardware and software components to implement an architecture that can be configured along three dimensions: redundant channels, redundant lanes, and integrity levels. The two dimensions of physical redundancy allow the definition of a wide variety of instances with different fault tolerance strategies. The integrity level dimension allows application components of different levels of criticality to coexist in the same instance. The paper describes the main concepts of the architecture, the supporting environments for development and validation, and the prototypes currently being implemented.},

abstract = {System event logs have been frequently used as a valuable resource in data-driven approaches to enhance system health and stability. A typical procedure in system log analytics is to first parse unstructured logs, and then apply data analysis on the resulting structured data. Previous work on parsing system event logs focused on offline, batch processing of raw log files. But increasingly, applications demand online monitoring and processing. We propose an online streaming method Spell, which utilizes a longest common subsequence based approach, to parse system event logs. We show how to dynamically extract log patterns from incoming logs and how to maintain a set of discovered message types in streaming fashion. Evaluation results on large real system logs demonstrate that even compared with the offline alternatives, Spell shows its superiority in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

@article{Bauer2006,
abstract = {Distributed embedded systems have pervaded the automotive domain, but often still lack measures to ensure adequate behaviour in the presence of unforeseen events, or even errors at runtime. As interactions and dependencies within distributed automotive systems increase, the problem of detecting failures which depend on the exact situation and environment conditions they occur in grows. As a result, not only the detection of failures is increasingly difficult, but also the differentiation between the symptoms of a fault, and the actual fault itself, i. e., the cause of a problem. In this paper, we present a novel and efficient approach built around the notion of a software component similar to AUTOSAR, for dynamically analysing distributed embedded systems in the testing phase or even in standard operation, in that we provide a framework for detecting failures as well as identifying their causes. Our approach is based upon monitoring safety properties, specified in a language that allows to express dynamic system properties. For such specifications so-called monitor components are generated automatically to detect violations of software components. Based on the results of the monitors, a dedicated diagnosis is then performed in order to identify explanations for the misbehaviour of a system. These may be used to store detailed error logs, or to trigger recovery measures.},

Expressions of stance are associated with the speakers' view of what they are talking about and what is up for discussion and negotiation in the intersubjective exchange. Taking stance is thus crucial for the social construction of meaning. Increased knowledge of stance can be useful for many application fields such as business intelligence, security analytics, or social media monitoring. In order to process large amounts of text data for stance analyses, linguists need interactive tools to explore the textual sources as well as the processed data based on computational linguistics techniques. Both original texts and derived data are important for refining the analyses iteratively. In this work, we present a visual analytics tool for online social media text data that can be used to open up the investigation of stance phenomena. Our approach ...},

abstract = {Process-oriented data mining (process mining) uses algorithms and data (in the form of event logs) to construct models that aim to provide insights into organisational processes. The quality of the data (both form and content) presented to the modeling algorithms is critical to the success of the process mining exercise. Cleaning event logs to address quality issues prior to conducting a process mining analysis is a necessary, but generally tedious and ad hoc task. In this paper we describe a set of data quality issues, distilled from our experiences in conducting process mining analyses, commonly found in process mining event logs or encountered while preparing event logs from raw data sources. We show that patterns are used in a variety of domains as a means for describing commonly encountered problems and solutions. The main contributions of this article are in showing that a patterns-based approach is applicable to documenting commonly encountered event log quality issues, the formulation of a set of components for describing event log quality issues as patterns, and the description of a collection of 11 event log imperfection patterns distilled from our experiences in preparing event logs. We postulate that a systematic approach to using such a pattern repository to identify and repair event log quality issues benefits both the process of preparing an event log and the quality of the resulting event log. The relevance of the pattern-based approach is illustrated via application of the patterns in a case study and through an evaluation by researchers and practitioners in the field.},

abstract = {Runtime verification as a field faces several challenges. One key challenge is howto keep the overheads associated with its application low. This is especially important in real-time critical embedded applications, where memory and CPU resources are limited. Another challenge is that of devising expressive and yet user-friendly specification languages that can attract software engineers. In this paper, it is shown that for many systems, in-place logging provides a satisfactory basis for postmortem "runtime" verification of logs, where the overhead is already included in system design. Although this approach prevents an online reaction to detected errors, possible with traditional runtime verification, it provides a powerful tool for test automation and debugging-in this case, analysis of spacecraft telemetry by ground operations teams at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The second challenge is addressed in the presentedwork through a temporal specification language, designed in collaboration with Jet Propulsion Laboratory test engineers. The specification language allows for descriptions of relationships between data-rich events (records) common in logs, and is translated into a form of automata supporting data-parameterized states. The automaton language is inspired by the rule-based language of theRULER runtime verification system. A case study is presented illustrating the use of our LOGSCOPE tool by software test engineers for the 2011 Mars Science. 2010 by theAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Laboratory mission.},

In this context, in January 2016, the European Commission has funded seven projects that are to deal with various aspects of interoperability in the Internet of Things. Among them, the INTER-IoT project is aiming at the design and implementation of, and experimentation with, an open cross-layer framework and associated methodology to provide voluntary interoperability among heterogeneous IoT platforms. While the project considers interoperability across all layers of the software stack, we are particularly interested in answering the question: how ontologies and semantic data processing can be harnessed to facilitate interoperability across the IoT landscape. Henceforth, we have engaged in a “fact finding mission” to establish what is currently at our disposal when semantic interoperability is concerned. Since the INTER-IoT project is initially driven by two use cases originating from (i) (e/m)Health and (ii) transportation and logistics, these two application domains were used to provide context for our search. The paper summarizes our findings and provides foundation for developing methods and tools for supporting semantic interoperability in the INTER-IoT project (and beyond).},

abstract = {The ability to recognize and predict temporal sequences of sensory in- puts is vital for survival in natural environments. Based on many known properties of cortical neurons, hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) se- quence memory recently has been proposed as a theoretical framework for sequence learning in the cortex. In this letter, we analyze properties of HTM sequencememory and apply it to sequence learning and prediction problems with streamingdata.Weshow the model is able to continuously learn a large number of variable order temporal sequences using an unsu- pervised Hebbian-like learning rule. The sparse temporal codes formed bythemodelcan robustlyhandlebranchingtemporalsequencesbymain- taining multiple predictions until there is sufficient disambiguating ev- idence. We compare the HTM sequence memory with other sequence learning algorithms, including statistical methods—autoregressive inte- grated moving average; feedforward neural networks—time delay neural network and online sequential extreme learning machine; and recurrent neural networks—long short-term memory and echo-state networks on sequence prediction problems with both artificial and real-world data. The HTM model achieves comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art algorithms. The model also exhibits properties that are critical for se- quence learning, including continuous online learning, the ability to handle multiple predictions and branching sequences with high-order statistics, robustness to sensor noise and fault tolerance, and good per- formance without task-specific hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, the HTM sequence memory not only advances our understanding of how the brain may solve the sequence learning problem but is also applicable to real-world sequence learning problems from continuous data streams.},

abstract = {Modern Internet systems often combine different ap- plications (e.g., DNS, web, and database), span differ- ent administrative domains, and function in the context of network mechanisms like tunnels, VPNs, NATs, and overlays. Diagnosing these complex systems is a daunt- ing challenge. Although many diagnostic tools exist, they are typically designed for a specific layer (e.g., tracer- oute) or application, and there is currently no tool for reconstructing a comprehensive view of service behav- ior. In this paper we propose X-Trace, a tracing frame- work that provides such a comprehensive view for sys- tems that adopt it. We have implemented X-Trace in sev- eral protocols and software systems, and we discuss how it works in three deployed scenarios: DNS resolution, a three-tiered photo-hosting website, and a service ac- cessed through an overlay network.},

abstract = {A non-hierarchical system in which distributed meta-levels mutually monitor and repair each other can act collectively as a self-protective system. Such a system can resist attacks against any part of itself, including its self-monitoring and self-repair processes. A distributed self-model is acquired by a process of bootstrapping where the different components learn by mutually ob-serving each others' internal processes. In this paper, we argue that such a decentralised architecture is also capable of high level reasoning and self-explanation. Using some examples, we show how objectively de-fined interactions between distributed software compo-nents can be translated into a subjective narrative about the agent's own mental states. Furthermore, the global coordination needed to provide coherent actions and ex-planations is possible in a decentralised architecture, provided that the meta-level which is managing the co-ordination is also subjected to critical monitoring and modification. An important principle is that the dif-ferent meta-levels are not necessarily static components but are best understood as different roles, for which the same components may be re-used in multiple contexts.},

improve that situation, a semantic interoperability evaluation model is

a further (computerized) automation of the automation. The
interoperability assessment is more reliable than what available
state-of-the art engineering and commissioning tools can deliver. This

On the one hand, more and more events are being recorded thus providing detailed information about the history of processes. Despite the omnipresence of event data, most organizations diagnose problems based on fiction rather than facts. On the other hand, vendors of Business Process Management (BPM) and Business Intelligence (BI) software have been promising miracles. Although BPM and BI technologies received lots of attention, they did not live up to the expectations raised by academics, consultants, and software vendors.},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the role of middleware in enabling robust and resilient cyber-physical systems (CPSs) of the future. In particular, we will focus on how adaptation services can be used to improve dependability in instrumented cyber-physical systems based on the principles of “computational reflection.” CPS environments incorporate a variety of sensing and actuation devices in a distributed architecture; such a deployment is used to create a digital representation of the evolving physical world and its processes for use by a broad range of applications. CPS applications, in particular, mission critical tasks, must execute dependably despite disruptions caused by failures and limitations in sensing, communications, and computation. This paper discusses a range of applications, their reliability needs, and potential dependability holes that can cause performance degradation and application failures. In particular, we distinguish between the notion of infrastructure and information dependability and illustrate the need to formally model and reason about a range of CPS applications and their dependability needs. Formal methods based tools can help us design meaningful cross-layer adaptation techniques at different system layers of the CPS environment and thereby achieve end-to-end dependability at both the infrastructure and information levels.},

abstract = {Self-adaptation is an inherent part of any natural and intelligent system. Specifically, it is about the ability of a system to reconcile its requirements or goal of existence with the environment it is interacting with, by adopting an optimal behavior. Self-adaptation becomes crucial when the environment changes dynamically over time. In this paper, we investigate self-adaptation of classification systems at three levels: (1) natural adaptation of the base learners to change in the environment, (2) contributive adaptation when combining the base learners in an ensemble, and (3) structural adaptation of the combination as a form of dynamic ensemble. The present study focuses on neural network classification systems to handle a special facet of self-adaptation, that is, incremental learning (IL). With IL, the system self-adjusts to accommodate new and possibly non-stationary data samples arriving over time. The paper discusses various IL algorithms and shows how the three adaptation levels are inherent in the system's architecture proposed and how this architecture is efficient in dealing with dynamic change in the presence of various types of data drift when applying these IL algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = { Traditional problem determination techniques rely on static dependency models that are difficult to generate accurately in today's large, distributed, and dynamic application environments such as e-commerce systems. We present a dynamic analysis methodology that automates problem determination in these environments by 1) coarse-grained tagging of numerous real client requests as they travel through the system and 2) using data mining techniques to correlate the believed failures and successes of these requests to determine which components are most likely to be at fault. To validate our methodology, we have implemented Pinpoint, a framework for root cause analysis on the J2EE platform that requires no knowledge of the application components. Pinpoint consists of three parts: a communications layer that traces client requests, a failure detector that uses traffic-sniffing and middleware instrumentation, and a data analysis engine. We evaluate Pinpoint by injecting faults into various application components and show that Pinpoint identifies the faulty components with high accuracy and produces few false-positives.},

@article{Kennedy2003,
abstract = {In a hostile environment, an autonomous system requires a reflective capability to detect problems in its own operation and recover from them without external intervention. We approach this problem from the point of view of cognitive systems research. The simplest way to make such an autonomous system reflective is to include a layer in its architecture to monitor its components' behaviour patterns and detect anomalies. There are situations, however, where the reflective layer will not detect anoma-lies in itself. For example, it cannot detect that it has just been deleted, or completely replaced with hostile code. Our solution to this problem is to distribute the reflection so that components mutually observe and protect each other. Multiple versions of the anomaly-detection system acquire models of each other's " normal " behaviour patterns by mutual observation in a protected environment; they can then compare these models against actual patterns in an environment allowing damage or intrusions, in order to detect anomalies in each other's behaviour. Diagnosis and recovery actions can then follow. In this thesis we present some proof-of-concept implementations of distributed reflection based on multi-agent systems and show that such systems can survive in a hostile environment while their self-monitoring and self-repair components are repeatedly being attacked. The thesis also compares the cognitive systems paradigm used in the implementations with the paradigm of distributed fault-tolerance and considers the contributions that one field can make to the other.},

abstract = {Data-Intensive infrastructures are increasingly used for on- line processing of live data to guide operations and decision making. VScope is a flexible monitoring and analysis middleware for troubleshoot- ing such large-scale, time-sensitive,multi-tier applications. With VScope, lightweight anomaly detection and interaction tracking methods can be run continuously throughout an application's execution. The runtime events generated by these methods can then initiate more detailed and heavier weight analyses which are dynamically deployed in the places where they may be most likely fruitful for root cause diagnosis and mit- igation. We comprehensively evaluate VScope prototype in a virtualized data center environment with over 1000 virtual machines (VMs), and apply VScope to a representative on-line log processing application. Ex- perimental results show that VScope can deploy and operate a variety of on-line analytics functions and metrics with a few seconds at large scale. Compared to traditional logging approaches, VScope based troubleshoot- ing has substantially lower perturbation and generates much smaller log data volumes. It can also resolve complex cross-tier or cross-software-level issues unsolvable solely by application-level or per-tier mechanisms},

abstract = {Much of the software we use for everyday purposes incorporates elements developed and maintained by someone other than the developer. These elements include not only code and databases but also dynamic data feeds from online data sources. Although everyday software is not mission critical, it must be dependable enough for practical use. This is limited by the dependability of the incorporated elements. It is particularly difficult to evaluate the dependability of dynamic data feeds, because they may be changed by their proprietors as they are used. Further, the specifications of these data feeds are often even sketchier than the specifications of software components. We demonstrate a method of inferring invariants about the normal behavior of dynamic data feeds. We use these invariants as proxies for specifications to perform on-going detection of anomalies in the data feed. We show the feasibility of our approach and demonstrate its usefulness for semantic anomaly detection: identifying occasions when a dynamic data feed is delivering unreasonable values, even though its behavior may be superficially acceptable (i.e., it is delivering parsable results in a timely fashion).},

@article{Ahmad2017,
abstract = {We are seeing an enormous increase in the availability of streaming, time-series data. Largely driven by the rise of connected real-time data sources, this data presents technical challenges and opportunities. One fundamental capability for streaming analytics is to model each stream in an unsupervised fashion and detect unusual, anomalous behaviors in real-time. Early anomaly detection is valuable, yet it can be difficult to execute reliably in practice. Application constraints require systems to process data in real-time, not batches. Streaming data inherently exhibits concept drift, favoring algorithms that learn continuously. Furthermore, the massive number of independent streams in practice requires that anomaly detectors be fully automated. In this paper we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm that meets these constraints. The technique is based on an online sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We also present results using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), a benchmark containing real-world data streams with labeled anomalies. The benchmark, the first of its kind, provides a controlled open-source environment for testing anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. We present results and analysis for a wide range of algorithms on this benchmark, and discuss future challenges for the emerging field of streaming analytics.},

abstract = {Cyberphysical systems (CPSs) are being increasingly deployed in critical infrastructures such as electric power, water, transportation, and other networks. These deployments are facilitating real-time monitoring and closed-loop control by exploiting advances in wireless sensor-actuator networks, the Internet of Everything, data-driven analytics, and machine-to-machine interfaces. CPS operations depend on the synergy of computational and physical components. In addition, in many cases, CPSs also interact with human decision makers. Fundamentally, once we admit that CPS operations depend on actions of humans (albeit to different degrees), we also have to admit that malicious entities could take charge of CPS control by exploiting cyber insecurities or physical faults, or their combination. Therefore, to improve CPS resilience, we need diagnostic tools and automatic control algorithms that ensure survivability in the presence of both security attacks and random faults and include models of the incentives of human decision makers in the design process. Recent incidents (e.g., the Stuxnet attack) confirm that control systems for critical infrastructures are targets of highly motivated teams of attackers with access to ample financial and technical resources. Cyber vulnerabilities arise in CPSs due to: • Wider deployment of off-the-shelf information technology (IT) devices. CPSs inherit the vulnerabilities of these devices and thus are subject to software bugs and hardware failures. • Replacement of proprietary protocols and closed networks with standard open Internet protocols and shared networks. Malicious attackers capable of exploiting protocol and network insecurities can target CPS operations. • Generation, use, and modification of CPS data by multiple parties. This poses new challenges in access control and authorization among the strategic players, such as the operators, the IT vendors, and the end users. • The presence of a large number of remotely accessible field devices. Thus, sensor-control data becomes prone to adversarial manipulation. Cyber attacks on CPS control elements can result in the loss of availability (denial-of-service attack) and/or integrity (deception attack) of safety-critical measurement and control data. In December 2012, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a map of approximately 7,200 control system devices that appear to be directly linked to the Internet and are vulnerable to attack. From: The Impact of Control Technology, 2 nd ed., T. Samad and A.M. Annaswamy (eds.), 2014. Available at www.ieeecss.org. Resilient operation of CPSs requires the following high-confidence attributes: functional correctness (by design) for real-time operations, robustness to reliability failures (fault tolerance), and survivability even during successful attacks (operation through attacks). Designers and operators of CPSs currently lack comprehensive tools for resilient operation. Major challenges include: (1) spatiotemporal and hybrid dynamics of cyberphysical processes; (2) a large number of interactions with interdependencies; and (3) effects of public and private uncertainties. Notably, two distinct domains of tools have emerged to respond to these challenges: • Robust control over networks: These tools primarily address safety and performance issues in closed-loop control over sensor-actuator networks. • Theory of incentives: These tools provide ways to analyze and influence the strategic interactions of human decision makers. To date, control and incentive tools have been designed and implemented separately. This separation was natural due to the lack of advanced CPS technologies in legacy supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Modern CPSs no longer permit such separation of control and incentive tools. The failure of loosely coupled tools in ensuring resilient operation of CPSs is evident in chronically unresolved design conflicts between efficiency and robustness against faults and attacks and the lack of proper incentive structures to enable private entities (or players) that operate the CPSs to maintain resilience. Consequently, control and incentive tools designed in isolation, or without cognizance of strategic interactions between private entities and interdependent processes in CPSs, are inadequate to maintain resilience.},

Creating a workflow design is a complicated time-consuming process and, typically, there are discrepancies between the actual workflow processes and the processes as perceived by the management. Therefore, we have developed techniques for discovering workflow models. The starting point for such techniques is a so-called "workflow log" containing information about the workflow process as it is actually being executed. We present a new algorithm to extract a process model from such a log and represent it in terms of a Petri net. However, we also demonstrate that it is not possible to discover arbitrary workflow processes. We explore a class of workflow processes that can be discovered. We show that the $\alpha$-algorithm can successfully mine any workflow represented by a so-called SWF-net.},

abstract = {Software systems dealing with distributed applications in changing environments normally re- quire human supervision to continue operation in all conditions. These (re-)configuring, trou- bleshooting, and in general maintenance tasks lead to costly and time-consuming procedures during the operating phase. These problems are primarily due to the open-loop structure often followed in software development. Therefore, there is a high demand for management complexity reduction, management automation, robustness, and achieving all of the desired quality require- ments within a reasonable cost and time range during operation. Self-adaptive software is a response to these demands; it is a closed-loop system with a feedback loop aiming to adjust itself to changes during its operation. These changes may stem from the software system's self (internal causes e.g., failure) or context (external events e.g., increasing requests from users). Such a sys- tem is required to monitor itself and its context, detect significant changes, decide how to react, and act to execute such decisions. These processes depend on adaptation properties (called self-* properties), domain characteristics (context information or models), and preferences of stakehold- ers. Noting these requirements, it is widely believed that new models and frameworks are needed to design self-adaptive software. This survey article presents a taxonomy, based on concerns of adaptation, i.e., how, what, when and where, towards providing a unified view of this emerging area. Moreover, as adaptive systems are encountered in many disciplines, it is imperative to learn from the theories and models developed in these other areas. This survey article presents a land- scape of research in self-adaptive software by highlighting relevant disciplines and some prominent research projects. This landscape helps to identify the underlying research gaps and elaborates on the corresponding challenges.},

abstract = {Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) networks are increasingly under 
attack. In a world of wireless networks, removable media, and a desire to move to 
the “Internet of Things,” it is unrealistic to think that these networks can be isolated 
from every threat. Devices on SCADA networks are often not designed with security 
in mind, vendors are slow to create patches, and the systems usually are critical 
enough that scheduling downtime is a problem. A layered approach to securing 
SCADA networks that includes both patching and monitoring is essential to the 
safety of those systems. This paper discusses a method of discovering attacks on a 
SCADA network by using a honeypot. An analysis of a facilitiesQbased SCADA 
network was performed, a honeypot designed and built to mimic the common 
services of this network, and monitoring was put in place to detect when the 
honeypot was targeted. This resulted in more comprehensive monitoring of the 
SCADA network for attacks and added another layer of security to the existing 
patching routine.},

HTTP adaptive streaming addresses these problems for multimedia unicast services, but it is not efficient from the point of view of radio resource consumption. In Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks, multimedia broadcast services are provided over a common radio channel using a combination of forward error correction and unicast error recovery techniques at the application level. This paper discusses how to avoid service disruptions and reduce service latency for LTE multimedia broadcast services by adding dynamic adaptation capabilities to the unicast error recovery process. The proposed solution provides a seamless mobile multimedia broadcasting without compromising the quality of the service perceived by the users.},

abstract = {Modern Internet services are often implemented as complex, large-scale distributed systems. These applications are constructed from collections of software modules that may be developed by different teams, perhaps in different programming languages, and could span many thousands of machines across multiple physical facilities. Tools that aid in understanding system behavior and reasoning about performance issues are invaluable in such an environment. Here we introduce the design of Dapper, Googles production distributed systems tracing infrastructure, and describe how our design goals of low overhead, application-level transparency, and ubiquitous deployment on a very large scale system were met. Dapper shares conceptual similarities with other tracing systems, particularly Magpie 3 and X-Trace 12, but certain design choices were made that have been key to its success in our environment, such as the use of sampling and restricting the instrumentation to a rather small number of common libraries. The main goal of this paper is to report on our experience building, deploying and using the system for over two years, since Dappers foremost measure of success has been its usefulness to developer and operations teams. Dapper began as a self-contained tracing tool but evolved into a monitoring platform which has enabled the creation of many different tools, some of which were not anticipated by its designers. We describe a few of the analysis tools that have been built using Dapper, share statistics about its usage within Google, present some example use cases, and discuss lessons learned so far.},

abstract = {An increasing number of distributed applications requires processing continuously flowing data from geographically distributed sources at unpredictable rate to obtain timely responses to complex queries. Examples of such applications come from the most disparate fields: from wireless sensor networks to financial tickers, from traffic management to click stream inspection. These requirements led to the development of a number of systems specifically designed to process information as a flow according to a set of pre-deployed processing rules. We collectively call them Information Flow Processing (IFP) Systems. Despite having a common goal, IFP systems differ in a wide range of aspects, including architectures, data models, rule languages, and processing mechanisms. In this tutorial we draw a general framework to analyze and compare the results achieved so far in the area of IFP systems. This allows us to offer a systematic overview of the topic, favoring the communication between different communities, and highlighting a number of open issue that still need to be addressed in research. {\&}copy; 2011 Authors.},

@article{Kennedy2003a,
abstract = {In a hostile environment, an autonomous system requires a reflective capability to detect problems in its own operation and recover from them without external intervention. We approach this problem from the point of view of cognitive systems research. The simplest way to make such an autonomous system reflective is to include a layer in its architecture to monitor its components' behaviour patterns and detect anomalies. There are situations, however, where the reflective layer will not detect anoma-lies in itself. For example, it cannot detect that it has just been deleted, or completely replaced with hostile code. Our solution to this problem is to distribute the reflection so that components mutually observe and protect each other. Multiple versions of the anomaly-detection system acquire models of each other's " normal " behaviour patterns by mutual observation in a protected environment; they can then compare these models against actual patterns in an environment allowing damage or intrusions, in order to detect anomalies in each other's behaviour. Diagnosis and recovery actions can then follow. In this thesis we present some proof-of-concept implementations of distributed reflection based on multi-agent systems and show that such systems can survive in a hostile environment while their self-monitoring and self-repair components are repeatedly being attacked. The thesis also compares the cognitive systems paradigm used in the implementations with the paradigm of distributed fault-tolerance and considers the contributions that one field can make to the other.},

abstract = {The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has quickly moved from the realm of hype to reality with estimates of over 25 billion devices deployed by 2020. While IoT has huge potential for societal impact, it comes with a number of key security challenges—IoT devices can become the entry points into critical infrastructures and can be exploited to leak sensitive information. Traditional host-centric security solutions in today's IT ecosystems (e.g., antivirus, software patches) are fundamentally at odds with the realities of IoT (e.g., poor vendor security practices and constrained hardware). We ar- gue that the network will have to play a critical role in se- curing IoT deployments. However, the scale, diversity, cy- berphysical coupling, and cross-device use cases inherent to IoT require us to rethink network security along three key dimensions: (1) abstractions for security policies; (2) mech- anisms to learn attack and normal profiles; and (3) dynamic and context-aware enforcement capabilities. Our goal in this paper is to highlight these challenges and sketch a roadmap to avoid this impending security disaster.},

abstract = {Software faults are recognized to be among the main responsible for system failures in many application domains. Event logs play a key role to support the analysis of failures occurring under real workload conditions. Nevertheless, field experience suggests that event logs may be inaccurate at reporting software failures or they fail to provide accurate support for understanding their causes. This paper analyzes the factors that determine accurate detection of software failures through event logs. The study is based on a data set of 17,387 experiments where failures have been induced by means of software fault injection into three systems. Analysis reveals that the reporting ability of logs collected during the experiments, is not influenced by the type of fault that is activated at runtime. More importantly, analysis demonstrates that, despite the considered systems adopt very similar detection mechanisms, the ability of logs at reporting a given type of failure changes significantly across the systems. A closer inspection of collected logs reveals that characteristics, such as system architecture, placement of the logging instructions and specific supports provided by the execution environment, significantly increase accuracy of logs at runtime.},

abstract = {Software rarely works as intended when it is first written. Software engineering research has long been concerned with assessing why software fails and who is to blame, or why a piece of software is flawed and how to prevent such faults in the future. Errors are examined in the context of bugs, elements of source code that produce undesirable, unexpected and unintended deviations in behaviour. Though error is a prevalent, mature topic within software engineering, error detection and recovery are less well understood. This research uses rich qualitative methods to study error detection and recovery in professional software development practice. It has considered conceptual representations of error in software engineering research and trade literature. Using ethnographic principles, it has gathered accounts given by professional developers in interviews and in video-recorded paired interaction. Developers performing a range of tasks were observed, and findings were compared to theories of human error formed in psychology and safety science. Three empirical studies investigated error from the perspective of developers, recon- structing the view they hold when errors arise, to build a catalogue of active encounters with error in conceptual design, at the desk and after the fact. Analyses were structured to consider development holistically over time, rather than in terms of discrete tasks. By placing emphasis on “local rationality”, analytical focus was redirected from outcomes toward factors that influence performance. The resultant observations are assembled in an account of error handling in software development as personal and situated (in time and the developer's environment), with implications for the changing nature of expertise.},

The approach leverages artifacts produced at system design time and puts forth a set of rules to formalize the placement of the logging instructions within the source code. The validity of the approach, with respect to traditional logging mechanisms, is shown by means of around 12,500 software fault injection experiments into real-world systems.},

abstract = {Most existing literature on reflective architectures is concerned with language interpreters and object-oriented programming methods. In contrast, there is little work on reflective architectures which enable an autonomous system to have these types of access to its own operation for the purpose of survival in a hostile environment. Using the principles of natural immune systems, we present an autonomous system architecture which first acquires a model of its own normal operation and then uses this model to detect and repair faults and intrusions (self/nonself discrimination in immune systems). To enable the system to repair damage in any part of its operation, including its monitoring and repair mechanisms, the architecture is distributed so that all components are monitored by some other component within the system. We have distributed the system in the form of mutually protecting agents which monitor and repair each other{\&}apos;s self-protection mechanisms},

abstract = {As modern software-based systems and applications gain in versatility and functionality, the ability to manage inconsistent resources and service disparate user requirements becomes increasingly imperative. Furthermore, as systems increase in complexity, rectification of system faults and recovery from malicious attacks become more difficult, labor-intensive, expensive, and error-prone. These factors have actuated research dealing with the concept of self-healing systems. Self-healing systems attempt to "heal" themselves in the sense of recovering from faults and regaining normative performance levels independently the concept derives from the manner in which a biological system heals a wound. Such systems employ models, whether external or internal, to monitor system behavior and use inputs obtaining therefore to adapt themselves to the run-time environment. Researchers have approached this concept from several different angles this paper surveys research in this field and proposes a strategy of synthesis and classification. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Data-Intensive infrastructures are increasingly used for on- line processing of live data to guide operations and decision making. VScope is a flexible monitoring and analysis middleware for troubleshoot- ing such large-scale, time-sensitive,multi-tier applications. With VScope, lightweight anomaly detection and interaction tracking methods can be run continuously throughout an application's execution. The runtime events generated by these methods can then initiate more detailed and heavier weight analyses which are dynamically deployed in the places where they may be most likely fruitful for root cause diagnosis and mit- igation. We comprehensively evaluate VScope prototype in a virtualized data center environment with over 1000 virtual machines (VMs), and apply VScope to a representative on-line log processing application. Ex- perimental results show that VScope can deploy and operate a variety of on-line analytics functions and metrics with a few seconds at large scale. Compared to traditional logging approaches, VScope based troubleshoot- ing has substantially lower perturbation and generates much smaller log data volumes. It can also resolve complex cross-tier or cross-software-level issues unsolvable solely by application-level or per-tier mechanisms},

abstract = {Accompanying the increasing interest in vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs), there is a request for high-quality and real-time video streaming on a VANET, for safety and infotainment applications. Video streaming on a VANET faces extra issues, in comparison with the video streaming on a mobile ad hoc network (MANET), such as the highly dynamic topology. However, there are also benefits to VANETs, such as large buffer and battery capacity, predictable motion of vehicles, and powerful central and graphic processing units (CPU and GPU, respectively). However, the high packet loss ratio of a VANET is a critical issue for high-quality video streaming. In this paper, we propose an error recovery process for high-quality and real-time video streaming in a VANET, which is call multichannel error recovery video streaming (MERVS). MERVS transmits the video through two different channels: a reliable channel and an unreliable channel. Because of the importance of the intraframes (I-frames) in terms of video quality, I-frames will be transmitted through the reliable channel. The interframes will be transmitted through the unreliable channel because of the limited resource of the reliable channel. The priority queue, quick start, and scalable reliable channel (SRC) techniques are also integrated to improve the delay of MERVS. Based on the conducted simulation results, MERVS can provide higher quality video streaming compared with forward error correction (FEC) with similar time delay compared with the real-time transport protocol/user datagram protocol (RTP/UDP) in a VANET.},

abstract = {Software faults are recognized to be among the main responsible for system failures in many application domains. Event logs play a key role to support the analysis of failures occurring under real workload conditions. Nevertheless, field experience suggests that event logs may be inaccurate at reporting software failures or they fail to provide accurate support for understanding their causes. This paper analyzes the factors that determine accurate detection of software failures through event logs. The study is based on a data set of 17,387 experiments where failures have been induced by means of software fault injection into three systems. Analysis reveals that the reporting ability of logs collected during the experiments, is not influenced by the type of fault that is activated at runtime. More importantly, analysis demonstrates that, despite the considered systems adopt very similar detection mechanisms, the ability of logs at reporting a given type of failure changes significantly across the systems. A closer inspection of collected logs reveals that characteristics, such as system architecture, placement of the logging instructions and specific supports provided by the execution environment, significantly increase accuracy of logs at runtime.},

Indeed, in a safety-critical Industrial IoT (IIoT) setting, such as a smart factory, harsh signal propagation conditions combined with interference from coexisting radio technologies operating in the same frequency band may lead to poor network performance or even application failures despite precautionary measures. Analyzing and troubleshooting such failures on a large scale is often difficult and time-consuming. In this paper, we share our experience in troubleshooting coexistence problems in operational IIoT networks by reporting on examples that show the possible hurdles in carrying out failure analysis. Our experience motivates the need for a user-friendly, automated failure analysis system, and we outline an architecture of such system that allows to observe multiple com-munication standards and unknown sources of interference.},

Various distributed system extensions were introduced for the implementation of fault tolerance in distributed software systems. These extensions rely mainly on the exchange of contextual information appended to every transmitted application specific message. Ideally, this information should be used for checkpointing, error detection, diagnosis and recovery should a transient failure occur later during the distributed program execution. In this paper, we present a generalized extension suitable for fault-tolerant distributed systems such as communication software systems and its detection capabilities are shown. Our extension is based on the execution of message validity test prior to the transmission of messages and the piggybacking of contextual information to facilitate the detection and diagnosis of transient faults in the distributed system.},

abstract = {Self-healing is an increasingly popular approach to ensure resiliency, that is, a proper adaptation to failures and attacks, in cyber-physical systems (CPS). A very promising way of achieving self-healing is through structural adaptation (SHSA), by adding and removing components, or even by changing their interaction, at runtime. SHSA has to be enabled and supported by the underlying platform, in order to minimize undesired interference during components exchange and to reduce the complexity of the application components. In this paper, we discuss architectural requirements and design decisions which enable SHSA in CPS. We propose a platform that facilitates structural adaptation and demonstrate its capabilities on an example from the automotive domain: a fault-tolerant system that estimates the state-of-charge (SoC) of the battery. The SHSA support of the SoC estimator is enhanced through the existence of an ontology, capturing the interrelations among the components and using this information at runtime for reconfiguration.

abstract = {The visual exploration of large and complex network structures remains a challenge for many application fields. Moreover, a growing number of real-world networks is multivariate and often interconnected with each other. Entities in a network may have relationships with elements of other related datasets, which do not necessarily have to be networks themselves, and these relationships may be defined by attributes that can vary greatly. In this work, we propose a comprehensive visual analytics approach that supports researchers to specify and subsequently explore attribute-based relationships across networks, text documents and derived secondary data. Our approach provides an individual search functionality based on keywords and semantically similar terms over the entire text corpus to find related network nodes. For examining these nodes in the interconnected network views, we introduce a new interaction technique, called Hub2Go, which facilitates the navigation by guiding the user to the information of interest. To showcase our system, we use a large text corpus collected from research papers listed in the visualization publication dataset that consists of 2752 documents over a period of 25 years. Here, we analyze relationships between various heterogeneous networks, a bag-of-words index and a word similarity matrix, all derived from the initial corpus and metadata.},

Due to its limitation of finding novel attacks, we propose a hybrid model based on improved fuzzy and data mining techniques, which can detect both misuse and anomaly attacks. The aim of our research is to reduce the amount of data retained for processing i.e., attribute selection process and also to improve the detection rate of the existing IDS using data mining technique. We then use improved Kuok fuzzy data mining algorithm, which in turn a modified version of APRIORI algorithm, for implementing fuzzy rules, which allows us to construct if-then rules that reflect common ways of describing security attacks. We applied fuzzy inference engine using mamdani inference mechanism with three variable inputs for faster decision making. The proposed model has been tested and benchmarked against DARPA 1999 data set for its efficiency and also tested against the ¿live¿ networking environment inside the campus and the results has been discussed.},

However, interoperability remains essential for future IoT deployments to facilitate the emergence of novel cross-domain applications and business opportunities. In this paper we present the interoperability approach pursued by the H2020 project symbIoTe which aims at creating a flexible interoperability framework supporting both semantic and organizational interoperability. While semantic interoperability, as a prerequisite for platform cooperation, has been widely addressed in literature, symbIoTe goes a step further to propose novel aspects of organizational interoperability by introducing a concept of IoT platform federations and roaming IoT devices. We present the symbIoTe architecture, highlight its major technical contributions, and provide an overview of current system implementation with focus on Cloud-based services which create a new perspective on IoT interoperability.},

It allows to gain insights into the failure behavior of a given system under real workload conditions, which is crucial to assure service continuity and downtime reduction. This paper proposes an experimental evaluation of different direct monitoring techniques, namely event logs, assertions, and source code instrumentation, that are widely used in the context of critical industrial systems. We inject 12,733 software faults in a real-world air traffic control (ATC) middleware system with the aim of analyzing the ability of mentioned techniques to produce information in case of failures. Experimental results indicate that each technique is able to cover a limited number of failure manifestations. Moreover, we observe that the quality of collected data to support failure diagnosis tasks strongly varies across the techniques considered in this study.},

The proposal generalizes the form of simple recovery facilities supported by nested atomic actions in which the exception mechanisms only permit backward error recovery. It allows the construction of systems using both forward and backward error recovery and thus allows the exploitation of the complementary benefits of the two schemes. Backward recovery, forward recovery, and normal processing activities can occur concurrently within the organization proposed. Exception handling is generalized to provide a uniform basis for fault tolerance schemes with the atomic action structure. The generalization includes a resolution scheme for concurrently raised exceptions based on an exception tree and an abortion scheme that permits the termination of the internal atomic actions. An automatic resolution mechanism is outlined for exceptions in atomic actions which allows users to separate their recovery schemes from the details of the underlying algorithms.},

This shift increased the probability that a fault occurring in an application propagates to others with the risk of a failure of the entire safety-critical system. This calls for new tools for the on-line detection of anomalous behaviors of the system, predicting thus a system failure before it happens, allowing the deployment of appropriate mitigation policies. The paper proposes a novel architecture, namely CASPER, for online failure prediction that has the distinctive features to be (i) black-box: no knowledge of applications internals and logic of the system is required (ii) non-intrusive: no status information of the components is used such as CPU or memory usage; The architecture has been implemented to predict failures in a real Air Traffic Control System. CASPER exhibits high degree of accuracy in predicting failures with low false positive rate. The experimental validation shows how operators are provided with predictions issued a few hundred of seconds before the occurrence of the failure.},

abstract = {A real-time life logging system that provide monitoring, recording and recognition of daily human activities using video cameras offers life-care or health-care services at smart homes. Such a vision-based life logging system can provide continuous monitoring and recording of a resident's daily activities from which one can obtain behavior patterns of daily life events and improve the quality of life especially for the elderly. This paper presents a real-time life logging system via depth imaging-based human activity recognition. A depth imaging device is utilized to obtain depth silhouettes of human activities. Then from the silhouettes, human body points information gets extracted and used in activity recognition, producing life logs. The system is composed of two key processes; one is training of the life logging system, and the other is running the trained life-logging system to record life logs. In the training process, the system includes the data collection from a depth camera, extraction of body points features from each depth silhouette and finally training of the activity recognizer (i.e., Hidden Markov Models). Then, after training, one can run the trained system which recognizes learned activities and store life logs in real-time. The proposed approach is evaluated against the life logging system that uses the conventional principal components (PC) and Radon transform features of depth silhouettes and achieves superior recognition rate. Real-time experimental results show the feasibility and functionality of the implemented system which could be used to generate life logs of human activities at smart homes.},

abstract = {The complexity of the National Airspace System (NAS) in the United States presents a number of novel and unique challenges for the integration of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). In particular, one challenging aspect is the modeling of UAS safety risk for civil applications given the scarcity of actual operational data. With the creation of a probabilistic model, inferences about changes to the states of the accident shaping or causal factors can be drawn quantitatively. These predictive safety inferences derive from qualitative reasoning to plausible conclusions based on data, assumptions, and/or premises and enable an analyst to identify the most prominent causal factors leading to a risk factor prioritization. Such an approach also facilitates the study of possible mitigation effects. This paper illustrates the development of an Object-Oriented Bayesian Network (OOBN) to AS (sUAS) with the mission of aerial surveying for a bridge infrastructure inspection. As a System of Systems (SoS) approach, an OOBN facilitates decomposition at the sub-system level yet enables synthesis at a higher-order systems level. In essence, the methodology serves as a predictive safety analytics platform to support reasoning to plausible conclusions from assumptions or premises.},

A hyperdimen-sional model is able to represent a broad range of linguistic and extra-linguistic features in a common integral framework which is suitable as a bridge between symbolic and continuous representations, as an encoding scheme for symbolic information and as a basis for feature space exploration.

Themodels are obtained by recursively partitioning the data space and fitting a simple prediction model within each partition. As a result, the partitioning can be represented graphically as a decision tree. Clas- sification trees are designed for dependent variables that take a finite number of unordered values, with prediction error measured in terms of misclassifica- tion cost. Regression trees are for dependent variables that take continuous or ordered discrete values, with prediction error typically measured by the squared difference between the observed and predicted values.

To confirm the effectiveness of HDN, two similar networks constructed by support vector machine and back propagation neuron networks (BPNN) are employed to present a comprehensive comparison.

abstract = {We are seeing an enormous increase in the availability of streaming, time-series data. Largely driven by the rise of connected real-time data sources, this data presents technical challenges and opportunities. One fundamental capability for streaming analytics is to model each stream in an unsupervised fashion and detect unusual, anomalous behaviors in real-time. Early anomaly detection is valuable, yet it can be difficult to execute reliably in practice. Application constraints require systems to process data in real-time, not batches. Streaming data inherently exhibits concept drift, favoring algorithms that learn continuously. Furthermore, the massive number of independent streams in practice requires that anomaly detectors be fully automated. In this paper we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm that meets these constraints. The technique is based on an online sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We also present results using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), a benchmark containing real-world data streams with labeled anomalies. The benchmark, the first of its kind, provides a controlled open-source environment for testing anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. We present results and analysis for a wide range of algorithms on this benchmark, and discuss future challenges for the emerging field of streaming analytics.},

abstract = {A real-time life logging system that provide monitoring, recording and recognition of daily human activities using video cameras offers life-care or health-care services at smart homes. Such a vision-based life logging system can provide continuous monitoring and recording of a resident's daily activities from which one can obtain behavior patterns of daily life events and improve the quality of life especially for the elderly. This paper presents a real-time life logging system via depth imaging-based human activity recognition. A depth imaging device is utilized to obtain depth silhouettes of human activities. Then from the silhouettes, human body points information gets extracted and used in activity recognition, producing life logs. The system is composed of two key processes; one is training of the life logging system, and the other is running the trained life-logging system to record life logs. In the training process, the system includes the data collection from a depth camera, extraction of body points features from each depth silhouette and finally training of the activity recognizer (i.e., Hidden Markov Models). Then, after training, one can run the trained system which recognizes learned activities and store life logs in real-time. The proposed approach is evaluated against the life logging system that uses the conventional principal components (PC) and Radon transform features of depth silhouettes and achieves superior recognition rate. Real-time experimental results show the feasibility and functionality of the implemented system which could be used to generate life logs of human activities at smart homes.},

XES is the standard format for process mining supported by the majority of process mining tools. XES was adopted in 2010 by the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining as the standard format for logging events. It is now in the process of becoming an official IEEE standard. Next to XES (eXtensible Event Stream) other target formats supported by ProM are MXML (Mining eXtensible Markup Language) and CSV files.

There are several tools to extract XES logs from various data sources. Next to ProM itself one can use XESame, ProMimport, of commercial tools like Disco.

Once the relevant data has been located, the extraction and conversion is fairly straightforward. The challenge is to select event data related to the questions an organisation has.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) idea, explored across the globe, brings about an important issue: how to achieve interoperability among multiple existing (and constantly created) IoT platforms. In this context, in January 2016, the European Commission has funded seven projects that are to deal with various aspects of interoperability in the Internet of Things. Among them, the INTER-IoT project is aiming at the design and implementation of, and experimentation with, an open cross-layer framework and associated methodology to provide voluntary interoperability among heterogeneous IoT platforms. While the project considers interoperability across all layers of the software stack, we are particularly interested in answering the question: how ontologies and semantic data processing can be harnessed to facilitate interoperability across the IoT landscape. Henceforth, we have engaged in a “fact finding mission” to establish what is currently at our disposal when semantic interoperability is concerned. Since the INTER-IoT project is initially driven by two use cases originating from (i) (e/m)Health and (ii) transportation and logistics, these two application domains were used to provide context for our search. The paper summarizes our findings and provides foundation for developing methods and tools for supporting semantic interoperability in the INTER-IoT project (and beyond).},

abstract = {Nowadays, with the big background of economic globalization, economic isolation became impossible, therefore, internationalization is necessary for development of enterprise. IKEA is a Swedish multinational group which was founded in 1943. Under the big background of economic globalization, IKEA sizes every opportunity to entry foreign markets And nowadays IKEA had already become the world wide largest furniture retailer since 2008. IKEA actually has already entered into Chinese market as early as 1998 .The success of IKEA in Chinese market is very outstanding. But it's not difficult to find on IKEA strategy map of China that the most retail stores are concentrate distributed in the first-tier cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong. And there are very less retail stores in Chinese inland cities and some of areas are still the market vacancy. China as a country who has the most population on the world is never lack of purchasing power. Therefore, a reasonable marketing strategy should be analyzed to help the expansion of IKEA in Chinese market. The research purpose of this thesis is to analyze a reasonable marketing entry strategy of IKEA for the further expansion in Chinese market. This research would follow the classical foreign market entry strategies analysis with three steps. And the research focus on answering these three questions: Where should be selected as new target market location of IKEA in China? Which entry mode of IKEA should be applied in the future Chinese market? Which factors would influence IKEA timing of entry in Chinese market? Which is through the multi research method. Summarizing IKEA marketing entry strategy in China is a gradual process. IKEA should firstly select the market location in the areas with lower cultural distance and high level of GDP and GDP per capital, and then gradually expand in to the areas with relatively higher cultural distance and relatively lower level of GDP and GDP per capital. And in general, this process also could be viewed as the expansion from the eastern costal area to the inland cities of China. And the gradual “internationalization” of IKEA in Chinese market also reflected on the entry mode choice. From the “joint venture” run to the coexisting of “joint venture” and “wholly owned subsidiary”, and finally run to the “wholly owned subsidiary” as the only entry mode of IKEA in Chinese market. Finally, as for the timing of entry, IKEA should catch the “window of opportunity”, accumulate “near market knowledge” and pay attention to “world-of-mouth” to remain the good reputation of IKEA in China to complete the},

abstract = {Logs are widely used in system management for dependability assurance because they are often the only data available that record detailed system runtime behaviors in production. Because the size of logs is constantly increasing, developers (and operators) intend to automate their analysis by applying data mining methods, therefore structured input data (e.g., matrices) are required. This triggers a number of studies on log parsing that aims to transform free-text log messages into structured events. However, due to the lack of open-source implementations of these log parsers and benchmarks for performance comparison, developers are unlikely to be aware of the effectiveness of existing log parsers and their limitations when applying them into practice. They must often reimplement or redesign one, which is time-consuming and redundant. In this paper, we first present a characterization study of the current state of the art log parsers and evaluate their efficacy on five real-world datasets with over ten million log messages. We determine that, although the overall accuracy of these parsers is high, they are not robust across all datasets. When logs grow to a large scale (e.g., 200 million log messages), which is common in practice, these parsers are not efficient enough to handle such data on a single computer. To address the above limitations, we design and implement a parallel log parser (namely POP) on top of Spark, a large-scale data processing platform. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate POP on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate the capability of POP in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and effectiveness on subsequent log mining tasks.},

abstract = {In a hostile environment, an autonomous system requires a reflective capability to detect problems in its own operation and recover from them without external intervention. We approach this problem from the point of view of cognitive systems research. The simplest way to make such an autonomous system reflective is to include a layer in its architecture to monitor its components' behaviour patterns and detect anomalies. There are situations, however, where the reflective layer will not detect anoma-lies in itself. For example, it cannot detect that it has just been deleted, or completely replaced with hostile code. Our solution to this problem is to distribute the reflection so that components mutually observe and protect each other. Multiple versions of the anomaly-detection system acquire models of each other's " normal " behaviour patterns by mutual observation in a protected environment; they can then compare these models against actual patterns in an environment allowing damage or intrusions, in order to detect anomalies in each other's behaviour. Diagnosis and recovery actions can then follow. In this thesis we present some proof-of-concept implementations of distributed reflection based on multi-agent systems and show that such systems can survive in a hostile environment while their self-monitoring and self-repair components are repeatedly being attacked. The thesis also compares the cognitive systems paradigm used in the implementations with the paradigm of distributed fault-tolerance and considers the contributions that one field can make to the other.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things paradigm envisions the pervasive interconnection and cooperation of smart things over the current and future Internet infrastructure. The Internet of Things is, thus, the evolution of the Internet to cover the real-world, enabling many new services that will improve people's everyday lives, spawn new businesses and make buildings, cities and transport smarter. Smart things allow indeed for ubiquitous data collection or tracking, but these useful features are also examples of privacy threats that are already now limiting the success of the Internet of Things vision when not implemented correctly. These threats involve new challenges such as the pervasive privacy-aware management of personal data or methods to control or avoid ubiquitous tracking and profiling. This paper analyzes the privacy issues in the Internet of Things in detail. To this end, we first discuss the evolving features and trends in the Internet of Things with the goal of scrutinizing their privacy implications. Second, we classify and examine privacy threats in this new setting, pointing out the challenges that need to be overcome to ensure that the Internet of Things becomes a reality.},

abstract = {This chapter proposes a “store‐recover‐forward” approach for effective video live streaming over wireless multihop networks. The “store‐recover‐forward” approach allows cooperative recovery that utilizes peer‐initiated network coding (NC) over a subset of received source packets. It introduces the wireless cooperative live streaming network. The chapter formulates the problems in study and analyzes their hardness. The chapter describes distributed algorithm Video Broadcasting with Cooperative Recovery (VBCR) in detail. Each node in VBCR independently determines the NC packets to code and which video packets to forward, given a certain target residual loss rate at its neighboring nodes. VBCR is fully distributed, with decisions based on only neighbor information and hence is scalable to a large group. The chapter presents illustrative simulation results. The simulation results show that VBCR with NC‐based cooperative recovery at intermediate nodes significantly outperforms other schemes in that VBCR uses reasonably low network traffic to achieve a low residual loss rate.},

Due to new computing trends, such as pervasive computing, miniaturization of IT leads to mobile devices with the emerging need for context adaptation. Therefore, it is beneficial that devices are able to adapt context. Hence, we propose to extend the definition of SASs and include context adaptation.

Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guideline presented in this report was derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers. The guideline has been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guideline covers three phases of a systematic review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. It is at a relatively high level. It does not consider the impact of question type on the review procedures, nor does it specify in detail mechanisms needed to undertake meta-analysis.},

abstract = {Context Systematic mapping studies are used to structure a research area, while systematic reviews are focused on gathering and synthesizing evidence. The most recent guidelines for systematic mapping are from 2008. Since that time, many suggestions have been made of how to improve systematic literature reviews (SLRs). There is a need to evaluate how researchers conduct the process of systematic mapping and identify how the guidelines should be updated based on the lessons learned from the existing systematic maps and SLR guidelines. Objective To identify how the systematic mapping process is conducted (including search, study selection, analysis and presentation of data, etc.); to identify improvement potentials in conducting the systematic mapping process and updating the guidelines accordingly. Method We conducted a systematic mapping study of systematic maps, considering some practices of systematic review guidelines as well (in particular in relation to defining the search and to conduct a quality assessment). Results In a large number of studies multiple guidelines are used and combined, which leads to different ways in conducting mapping studies. The reason for combining guidelines was that they differed in the recommendations given. Conclusion The most frequently followed guidelines are not sufficient alone. Hence, there was a need to provide an update of how to conduct systematic mapping studies. New guidelines have been proposed consolidating existing findings.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that integrates the Internet and physical objects belonging to different domains such as home automation, industrial process, human health and environmental monitoring. It deepens the presence of Internet-connected devices in our daily activities, bringing, in addition to many benefits, challenges related to security issues. For more than two decades, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been an important tool for the protection of networks and information systems. However, applying traditional IDS techniques to IoT is difficult due to its particular characteristics such as constrained-resource devices, specific protocol stacks, and standards. In this paper, we present a survey of IDS research efforts for IoT. Our objective is to identify leading trends, open issues, and future research possibilities. We classified the IDSs proposed in the literature according to the following attributes: detection method, IDS placement strategy, security threat and validation strategy. We also discussed the different possibilities for each attribute, detailing aspects of works that either propose specific IDS schemes for IoT or develop attack detection strategies for IoT threats that might be embedded in IDSs.},

abstract = {Modern software systems are expected to operate under uncertain conditions, without interruption. Possible causes of uncertainties include changes in the operational environment, dynamics in the availability of resources, and variations of user goals. The aim of self-adaptation is to let the system collect additional data about the uncertainties during operation. The system uses the additional data to resolve uncertainties, to reason about itself, and based on its goals to reconfigure or adjust itself to satisfy the changing conditions, or if necessary to degrade gracefully. In this chapter, we provide a particular perspective on the evolution of the field of self-adaptation in six waves. These waves put complementary aspects of engineering self-adaptive systems in focus that synergistically have contributed to the current knowledge in the field. From the presented perspective on the field, we outline a number of challenges for future research in self-adaptation, both in a short and long term.},
